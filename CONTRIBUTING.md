STEPS FOR CONTRIBUTING CODE

Github "pull requests" may (unfortunately?) not be used to submit a fix
to this project. Code changes needs to go through our code review system
and our commit validation system.

# Sign our Contributor License Agreement

Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) are common for projects under the
Apache license, and typically serve to grant control of the code to a central
entity. Because our code is available under the Apache License, signing the
CLA doesnâ€™t prevent you from using your code however you like, but it does
give Couchbase the ability to defend the source legally and build and maintain
a business around the technology.

1) [Join our review site](http://review.couchbase.org/)
2) Log into the review site.
3) [Fill out the agreement](http://review.couchbase.org/#/settings/agreements)
   under *Settings* > *Agreements*

# Make your changes and upload your changes

Once you're happy with your code changes upload your changes to the review site
and add "kv_engine_dev" as the reviewers. The commit validation system will
automatically build your change and run the unit tests.
