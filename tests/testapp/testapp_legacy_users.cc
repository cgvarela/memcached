/**
 * In order to support a smooth upgrade process to Spock where we introduced
 * RBAC ns_server creates a "legacy user" to represent the old "bucket user",
 * so that the user can still create a new "normal" user with the same name
 * as a bucket. This means that the system can have two users named "trond"
 * with different passwords. Internally these users are named:
 *
 *    "trond;legacy" - which is the old bucket user
 *    "trond" - which is the new user
 *
 * The legacy users is _ONLY_ available using the PLAIN sasl mechanism
 * (this is because it is used by XDCR which only support that mechanism)
 *
 * This test bach verifies that we can log in as these two users with
 * a different password, and that the legacy user is only available
 * when using PLAIN SASL mechanism.
